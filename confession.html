                        <div class="long-text">
                            <p>Let me state the obvious first—I like you. I don't want to overwhelm you, I just wanna express myself, considering that I might not have the slightest chance of this feeling being reciprocated and this should've been done face to face but nauna kang umuwi so here I go hehehe.</p>
                            
                            <p>This feeling is unique from what I've experienced before because I never planned on liking you, it just came naturally. From the moment we started talking, I felt the synchrony between our personalities because mega yappers pala tayo and I initially thought, "finally, another yapper friend yeyyy" but turns out, I'm wrong. I was mesmerized by your voice, that's what hooked me at first kasi ang ganda talaga ng voice mo, like legit. The more we hung out together, the more I realized that what I'm feeling towards you is different and I eventually fell for your personality. I don't know how to explain it, but with everytime I see you, I start acting differently. You're really something else HAHAHAHAHAH.
</p>
                            
                            <p>Now, this confession is just my way of telling and expressing what I feel towards you because I felt like you should know about this. I don't really expect a reciprocation but I am really want to get to know you deeply as a person, get to know your personality even more, your habits, everything. I like you, Angie. Merry Christmas, and God Bless you and your family.

            <h3>Also,here's an album I dedicated for you</h3>
            <p>
                Explanation: I know you like OPM and Musicals,
                so I figured this will be somewhat a bit out of your
                ordinary music. "A Song for Every Moon" is an album
                released by Bruno Major. In my own understanding, this
                album is about a journey of someone going through love and all that.
                I placed this here because whenever I listen to this, I think about how I
                went from seeing you as friend and transitioning to liking you more than a 
                friend. I dedicated the song "Like someone In Love" for you. Enjoyyy!!!!
            </p>
